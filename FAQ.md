## Grades

#### Who do I contact about a grading dispute?

For exams: [Dr. Enbody](mailto:enbody@cse.msu.edu) or [Dr. Zaabar](mailto:zaabarim@cse.msu.edu)

For everything else: [me](mailto:letting4@msu.edu)

#### When do our exam grades come back?

If you took the exam on Mimir: _usually_ the day after all students have taken it (i.e. after makeups have finished, in most cases).

If you took the paper exam: _usually_ up to a week after all students have taken it (i.e. after makeups have finished, in most cases).

#### When do lab/project grades come back?

*Usually* sometime before the next lab/project due date. The day can vary wildly depending on how busy I am that week.

#### How do I view your project feedback?

Go to your project submission on Mimir, there should be a light-blue button at the top-right of the page titled "Feedback".

#### Is there any leniency for close final grade boundaries?

Yes, actually. The professors will look for students who are at the edge of grade boundaries when the semester is over. The lower the boundary, the more lenient they'll be about rounding you up (so being rounded to a 2.0 is likelier than being rounded to a 4.0, for example). 

#### Are there any extra credit opportunities?

Sometimes. I'm not sure when they happen, or for what reason. To me, it just seems like whenever Dr. Enbody feels like throwin' one out. Extra credit has historically been small in terms of point yield.


## Meta

#### Who do I contact about an extension on [something]?

For exams: [Dr. Enbody](mailto:enbody@cse.msu.edu) or [Dr. Zaabar](mailto:zaabarim@cse.msu.edu)

For everything else: [me](mailto:letting4@msu.edu)

#### I missed [something], what should I do?

If you missed an exam, please contact [Dr. Enbody](mailto:enbody@cse.msu.edu) and/or [Dr. Zaabar](mailto:zaabar@cse.msu.edu).

If you missed an assignment due to illness or a personal emergency, please contact [me](mailto:letting4@msu.edu). Other cases for missing an assignment will not be considered.

#### Mimir is asking for a course code, what is ours?

There is no course code. Access Mimir from the link provided on our [D2L](https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/loginh/) page and it should get everything sorted for you.

#### I need extra help, any suggestions?

All of the TAs staff help room at certain points during the week, I highly recommend attending (applies to Fall/Spring only). 

Piazza is the fastest way to get answers, and offers anonymity if that's something you'd prefer.

[Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming) provides a great Python tutorial that could work as supplementary material if you feel you're lacking in reinforcement of content.

You may also contact [me](mailto:letting4@msu.edu), or another TA (assuming they're okay with you asking) if you need more personal help.

Some students want a tutor. The department does not have the resources to screen and train tutors, though some students have had luck finding one online through Facebook, Reddit, and universitytutor.com. Please be cautious with meeting people you find online — only meet in public areas.

#### Are we allowed to use a code editor that's not Spyder?

Yep! Though bear in mind that the TAs and professors may not be familiar with how some of them work, you'll be on your own if you need help with it.

Other popular code editors that I've heard good things about:
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Made by Microsoft, what I use)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (Made by Apple, MacOS only)

Certain projects pull from 3rd party libraries near the end of the semester, (namely `pylab`), Spyder comes packaged with it, which is why we use Spyder in the first place. You'll have to manually install `pylab` if you're on a different code editor, which I can show you how to do if you can't figure it out for yourself.

#### What do I do if I have a chromebook?

You'll have to install the DECS RDP client on your chromebook and use Anaconda/Spyder remotely on the DECS servers. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.egr.msu.edu/decs/help-support/how-to/connect-decs-remote-desktop-services-rds-servers). If you are experiencing issues installing the DECS Remote Client, take your chromebook to [DECS Support](https://www.egr.msu.edu/decs/help-support). 

Once installed, login to EGR RDP using your EGR credentials, and you should be free to use Anaconda/Spyder.

One student found [this tutorial](https://chromebook.home.blog/2019/01/20/installing-anaconda-on-a-chromebook-no-dev-beta-or-crouton-needed/) that may be another viable option if the above method doesn't work out well for you.

I unfortunately don't know much about ChromeOS, so if you're encountering trouble, I'd post a question to Piazza. There's bound to be at least one student or TA who's familiar with the operating system.

#### Are we allowed to use W3Schools and/or Programiz as supplementary material?

You're allowed to use any online resource that teaches Python — in fact, I often encourage students to use Programiz if they're looking for more material. But be careful, many online courses and tutorials teach subjects on Python that we won't be covering. It's usually best to go through our readings and lectures, and then refer to online resources for reinforcement and/or reference. 

#### Will there be exam statistics posted anywhere?

Dr. Enbody or Dr. Zaabar will have them in a post-exam email.

#### There's something on the repository that I think should be [added/moved/removed]. Can you do anything about it?

Yes! I'd be happy to, as long as it's within the realm of possibility and I think it'd be a good change. Please email [me](mailto:letting4@msu.edu) about it.


## Spyder

#### My shell and variable explorer disappeared. How do I get them back?

There is a tab at the top called "View". In View, there's a subcategory called "Panes". You can re-enable the shell and variable explorer here, among other windows.

Alternatively, you can go to the "Tools" tab, and hit "Reset Spyder to Factory Defaults". 

#### Running my program with the debugger executes the program normally.

You probably didn't set a breakpoint. 

#### Spyder isn't working.

Most problems with Spyder can be solved with a [reinstallation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/). Ensure that your problem is with *Spyder itself* and not your program's execution (did you call your `main()` function? Did you call your other functions?). 

If a reinstallation did not fix the problem, contact [me](mailto:letting4@msu.edu).

#### My program can't find this .txt/.csv file for some reason.

Verify the following things in your program before reading the instructions below:
- Did you spell the file name correctly? (Letter casing matches?)
- Did you include the file extension? (.txt, .csv, etc.)
- Do you have the file downloaded, and stored on your computer?

If you have verified these things, then here is a likely fix:

Any external file that your program is attempting to open has to be inside what's called your "Current Working Directory" or "CWD". I recommend placing the Python file you're working on right now inside the same folder as the .txt/.csv file you're attempting to open.

At the top-right of the Spyder window, there should be a folder path. This path is what Spyder believes to be your CWD. It's likely that this path is pointing somewhere else, so click the folder icon to the right to select the same folder you placed the Python file and the .txt/.csv file, and you should be all set.

Contact [me](mailto:letting4@msu.edu) if this did not fix the issue.

#### My program is saying that this external Python file could not be found.

See the above question, but replace '.txt/.csv file' with 'Python file' in your head.

#### My program is saying that the `pylab` module could not be found.

Try updating your Spyder installation (open Anaconda Navigator, click the gear icon at the top-right of Spyder's icon, and select "Update Application"). 

If the option is greyed-out and/or updating did not fix the issue, contact [me](mailto:letting4@msu.edu).


## Programming

#### How do you print an empty line?

You can use `print()` with no arguments.

Example:
```python
print("Line 1")
print()
print("Line 2")
```
Out:
```
Line 1

Line 2
```

#### Can you have multiple print statements display on the same line in console?

Yes. The `print()` function has a parameter called `end`, which specifies a `str` to concatenate to the back of the line that's being printed. It has a default value of `'\n'`, (the newline character), which is why print statements on subsequent lines in your code display text on subsequent lines in the console. 

Default behavior:
```python
print("Line 1")
print("Line 2")
```
Out:
```
Line 1
Line 2
```

Changing `end`:
```python
print("Line 1", end='')  # set to empty string
print("Line 2")
```
Out:
```
Line 1Line2
```

#### What's the best way to reverse a string/list?

Negative step indices. I think the `list` and `str` types also have a `.reverse()` method.

Example:
```python
my_str = 'hello'
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

print(my_str[::-1])
print(my_list[::-1])
```
Out:
```
olleh
[3, 2, 1]
```

#### What are the immutable and mutable types?

Immutable: `int`, `str`, `float`, `bool`, `tuple`

Mutable: `list`, `set`, `dict`

#### What's the difference between immutable and mutable types?

Immutable types _pass by copy_, while mutable types _pass by reference_.

Consider the following example. Recall that strings are immutable, and lists are mutable. 
```python
def my_function(obj):
    return obj

my_str = 'hello'
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# we're going to pass my_str and my_list to a function that simply returns its one parameter
new_str = my_function(my_str)
new_list = my_function(my_list)

# All seems well at first.
print("Before changes")
print("---")
print("my_str   = {}".format(my_str))
print("new_str  = {}".format(new_str))
print("my_list  = {}".format(my_list))
print("new_list = {}".format(new_list))

# now let's perform their corresponding appendation methods
new_str = new_str + ' world!'
new_list.append(4)

# notice what changed?
print("\nAfter changes")
print("---")
print("my_str   = {}".format(my_str))
print("new_str  = {}".format(new_str))
print("my_list  = {}".format(my_list))
print("new_list = {}".format(new_list))
```
Out:
```
Before changes
---
my_str   = hello
new_str  = hello
my_list  = [1, 2, 3]
new_list = [1, 2, 3]

After changes
---
my_str   = hello
new_str  = hello world!
my_list  = [1, 2, 3, 4]
new_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

So what happened here? `my_str` was left _unchanged_, while `new_str` was _changed_. `my_list` was _changed_, but `new_list` was also _changed_.

When `my_str` gets passed to `my_function()`, a _copy_ of `my_str`'s value gets passed to the `obj` parameter. We're taking that copy, and storing it in a new variable called `new_str` — and because it's a copy, changes made to `new_str` **_will not affect_** `my_str`. 

When `my_list` gets passed to `my_function()`, a _reference_ of `my_list` gets passed to the `obj` parameter. We're taking that reference, and storing it in a new variable called `new_list` — and because it's a reference, changes made to `new_list` **_will affect_** `my_list`. 

Note that this difference is also why many `list` method functions _don't_ require a variable reassignment. These are referred to as **in-place** method functions — only mutable types will have them for this reason. There are some operations between mutable and immutable types that may _seem_ identical at first, but have one or two key differences. For example:

```python
my_str = 'hello'
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

print(my_str[0])   # perfectly okay!
print(my_list[0])  # perfectly okay!

my_str[0] = 'y'  # RAISES ERROR
my_list[0] = 3   # perfectly okay!
```

#### Is there a way to quickly unpack multiple list/tuple values?

Yep! This was a relatively recent Python addition, actually.

```python
def example(a, b, c, d, e, f):
    print(a, b, c, d, e, f, sep='')

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# you use the asterisk symbol before the variable, it 
# will unpack each value in order (so for this example,
# it would be unpacked as a=1, b=2, c=3, etc.)
example(*my_list)

print("{}{}{}{}{}{}".format(*my_list))  # also convenient for filling up format-strings
```

#### How do you sort a dictionary by key?

```python
from operator import itemgetter

my_dict = {'c': 3, 'a': 1, 'd': 4, 'b': 2}

sorted_dict = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=itemgetter(0)))

print(sorted_dict)
```
Out:
```
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
```

#### How do you sort a dictionary by value?

```python
from operator import itemgetter

my_dict = {'c': 3, 'a': 1, 'd': 4, 'b': 2}

sorted_dict = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=itemgetter(1)))

print(sorted_dict)
```
Out:
```
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
```

#### How do you reverse the sorting order of `.sort()` or `sorted()`?

You can supply `True` to the `reverse` parameter.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

my_list.sort(reverse=True)

print(my_list)
```
Out:
```
[4, 3, 2, 1]
```

#### What is the difference between `.sort()` and `sorted()`?

`.sort()` is an in-place `list` method function. 

`sorted()` is a generic function that returns a sorted `list` copy of the given iterable.

#### Is there a way to assign multiple variables to the same value in one line?

Yes, but I don't recommend doing this. It's much better to put assignments on subsequent lines for readability. 

```python
a = b = c = 0
```

#### Can you iterate through multiple containers simultaneously?

Yes, you can with the `zip()` function. 

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = ['a', 'b', 'c']
c = [3.14, 2.718, 9.8]

for aval, bval, cval in zip(a, b, c):
    print(aval, bval, cval)
```
Out:
```
1 a 3.14
2 b 2.718
3 c 9.8
```

#### What is `self`?

`self` is a reference to the class instantiation. User-defined classes are mutable types by default, and so the class needs a way to refer back to what it contains. 

```python
# let's say we have a simple Vector class
class Vector(object):

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y 
    
    def mag(self):
        return (x**2 + y**2)**(1/2)

    def __str__(self):
        return "<{}, {}>".format(self.x, self.y)

# on instantiation, think of the parameter mapping as:
# Vector(self=Vector, x=1, y=2)
v = Vector(1, 2)

# for methods, think of self as being called by the instance being acted on:  
# mag(self=v)
m = v.mag()
```

I know how different it is from what we've become accustomed to, so this is a way of _thinking_ about the mapping of parameters when dealing with a class. It might not necessarily be what's happening behind the scenes.

#### Why is Mimir giving me a SIGPIPE error?

A SIGPIPE error usually occurs for one of the following reasons:
- Your program asked for an `input()` when Mimir wasn't expecting to input anything
- Your program is running when Mimir wasn't expecting it to run
- Your program is infinitely looping

There are many projects that have this chunk at the bottom of their starter-code:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Deleting this chunk will result in a SIGPIPE error more often than not. 

If you have this chunk, but you're still receiving a SIGPIPE error on Mimir, it's likely the first condition. Mimir *thinks* your program is infinitely looping because the `input()` function halts your program until the user enters something. Mimir wasn't expecting to enter anything, since it assumes your program's structure will follow its set of pre-programmed inputs. Try replicating Mimir's test case on your code editor to see where you have an extra `input()` prompt.
