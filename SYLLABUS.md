# CSE 231 - Introduction to Programming I

_Fall, 2020_

## Description
Introduction to programming using Python. Design, implementation and testing of programs to solve problems primarily in engineering, mathematics and science. Programming fundamentals, functions, classes, lists, and dictionaries.

## Objectives
In this course, students will study general programming concepts, as well as a modern programming language which illustrates those concepts. Students will design, implement and test Python programs.

At the end of this course, when presented with a problem, we expect that a student will respond: "Hey, I can write a program to do that!"

## Highlights
You are responsible for all of the details in the syllabus below, here are some of the main highlights:

- Grade Points: 1000 points are accrued from weekly programming projects, exercises, and three exams.
- Labs, including pre-labs, are required. Your final grade will be reduced if you miss more than two.
- If you collaborate on programming projects, you will get a zero. Usage of Chegg and other sites like it is disallowed.
- We frequently send emails from the @msu.edu and @cse.msu.edu domains. It is important that your email client isn't routing our emails to Junk -- otherwise you will miss critical emails about the course.

## Required Course Materials

__[The Practice of Computing using Python, 3rd Ed. by Punch and Enbody](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/product/Punch-Practice-of-Computing-Using-Python-The-3rd-Edition/9780134379760.html)__. 
- ISBN-13: 9780134379760 (or 9780134380315) 
    - Other ISBN-13 numbers are website-only, or are bundled with extraneous materials.
- Several copies are available in the Course Reserves at the MSU Main Library.

## Due Dates
The Due Dates Page is your guide to being successful this semester: https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/due_dates.html

To allow some flexibility:
- __Programming Projects__: Late submissions are reduced 50% for up to one day late; no credit after one day.
- __Labs__: Contact your TA about any extenuating circumstances _before_ lab. Old labs cannot be made up.

There is an exception for extreme circumstances, (e.g. a car crash puts you overnight in a hospital), there will be no other extensions.

It should be assumed that all times coming from us, (the TAs and professors), are in Eastern Standard Time (EST). If you are in a different timezone, do _not_ adjust your computer's clock. Mimir will do the conversion for you.

## Course Grades
Each student's course grade will be based on the sum of points earned in the following categories:
- Examinations	(45% of total course points)
- Computer Projects	(45% of total course points)
- Chapter Exercises	(10% of total course points)

To be eligible for a non-zero course grade, a student must earn at least 50% of the total points on exams, and earn at least 50% of the total points on computer projects.

Grading scale:

- 4.0 - 90% of points available
- 3.5 - 85% of points available
- 3.0 - 80% of points available
- 2.5 - 75% of points available
- 2.0 - 70% of points available
- 1.5 - 65% of points available
- 1.0 - 60% of points available

The instructor reserves the right to adjust the scale for course grades, if necessary. The instructor reserves the right to make changes in the course schedule and syllabus as necessary to facilitate learning.

__Important__: Students who get a zero ("no credit") on more than two (2) laboratory exercises will have their course grade reduced by 0.5 for _each laboratory exercise missed beyond two_. For example, if a student had sufficient points to normally earn a 3.0, but obtained four (4) zeroes on the laboratory exercises, that student's grade will be reduced by 2\*0.5, i.e. they will earn a 2.0 course grade.

## Exams
There will be two midterms and a final examination during the semester, and will constitute 45% of your total course grade. You will be allowed one sheet of notes (8.5x11 inches) both sides, but no electronic devices. Non-native English speakers may bring a paper dictionary.

Students will take exams remotely through Zoom. We require a camera (e.g., cellphone camera). The camera should be positioned such that you, your desk, and your entire screen is in view.
- Exam 1: Online - Tuesday, October 6th (10/6/20) at 7:00 PM EST
- Exam 2: Online - Tuesday, November 10th (11/10/20) at 7:00 PM EST
- Exam 3: Online - Wednesday, December 16th (12/16/20) at 5:45 PM EST

All issues related to the final examination will follow the policies and schedule of the University.

## Labs
Labs are mandatory. There will be one laboratory exercise due every week. Missing labs will reduce your final grade (see below).

The labs are designed to be learning tools that complement the lectures and assigned readings. They are designed to be collaborative experiences, where students work with the TA and others to complete the exercise.

Labs are credit/no-credit. To receive credit for a lab:
1. You must complete the Pre-Lab, before the lab itself or before the pre-lab deadline -- whichever comes first. Pre-labs are "warm-ups" for the labs and are not expected to be perfect -- our expectation is intentionally fuzzy for the pre-labs. You are expected to get most of them correct, most of the time.
2. When Mimir tests exist, they test for perfection. The Mimir tests allow you to verify that your code is correct. However, you can get credit for correct lab code that isn't perfect, i.e. it is possible to get credit for code that fails Mimir tests. (Note that Projects are more strict with respect to Mimir tests.)
3. Adhering to the Coding Standard is expected, but expectations are less strict than for projects.

Online students (Section 730) hand in lab exercises using Mimir, where they are due at 11:59 PM EST, usually on Fridays. 

__Important__: Students who get a zero ("no credit") on more than two (2) laboratory exercises will have their course grade reduced by 0.5 for _each laboratory exercise missed beyond two_. For example, if a student had sufficient points to normally earn a 3.0, but obtained four (4) zeroes on the laboratory exercises, that student's grade will be reduced by 2\*0.5, i.e. they will earn a 2.0 course grade.

## Chapter Exercises
Students will be assigned Chapter Exercises (on Mimir). Collaboration is encouraged.

Chapter Exercises constitute 10% of the course points. Chapter Exercises are recorded as Correct/Not-Correct. There is no limit to the number of tries to getting a chapter exercise correct. For each question, your solutions will be submitted if you click on either "Submit Assignment" or "Save Work". Final grades are not recorded until instructors manually hit the "grade" button.

## Computer Projects
A series of computer projects will be assigned, and will constitute 45% of the total course points. The projects will include the design and implementation of solutions using Python. Projects are submitted through Mimir. Late projects are not accepted (see exception above). If you are unable to complete a project by the due date because of illness or a personal emergency, contact your instructor. If appropriate, an extension will be granted.

Programming projects are to be done individually -- unlike labs and chapter exercises that are done collaboratively. If a programming project is done in collaboration with another student, you will both be assigned a zero, with an Academic Dishonesty report filed with the University. See the Academic Integrity section below.

## Academic Integrity
The Department of Computer Science and Engineering expects all students to adhere to MSU's General Student Regulation 1.00, Protection of Scholarship and Grades, which states:

> The principles of truth and honesty are fundamental to the educational process and the academic integrity of the University; therefore, no student shall:
> - 1.01 claim or submit the academic work of another as one's own.
> - 1.02 procure, provide, accept or use any materials containing questions or answers to any examination or assignment without proper authorization.
> - 1.03 complete or attempt to complete any assignment or examination for another individual without proper authorization.
> - 1.04 allow any examination or assignment to be completed for oneself, in part or in total, by another without proper authorization.
> - 1.05 alter, tamper with, appropriate, destroy or otherwise interfere with the research, resources, or other academic work of another person.
> - 1.06 fabricate or falsify data or results

In particular, examinations and computer projects are to be done *__individually__*.

For the computer projects, you are encouraged to *discuss* the specifications and problem-solving strategies with your instructor, and other students from the class. Once you begin implementing your solution, however, you must work individually. Under no circumstances should you allow another student to view or copy your work. All project solutions are electronically compared to each other. 

Students who submit similar solutions will receive a penalty grade, such as a zero for that assignment, or a zero overall course grade.

If you use and copy code from any of the pay-to-do-my-homework websites, e.g. Chegg, you will get a zero for the course. The use of such websites is a flagrant violation of MSU's policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, as well as the Spartan Honor Code. In all cases of penalty grades, an Academic Dishonesty report is filed with the University.

If you show code to another student, you are almost _guarenteed_ a zero, since most novice programmers will not be able to think of another solution.

Finally, consider the Spartan Honor Code: "As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do."

## Notes
Any extenuating circumstances that impact on your participation in the course should be discussed with your lecture instructor as soon as those circumstances are known (such as absences due to illness, religious observances, or other required school activities).

All students are expected to be responsible users of the computer systems provided for this course.

Commercialization of lecture notes and course materials is not permitted.
