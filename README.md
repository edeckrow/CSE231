# PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING

This is an archived copy of a repository I used to run for my students when I was a TA for CSE231. I (Braedyn Lettinga) no longer teach this course. Please do not contact me with questions regarding content from this course if you do not know me, or if you were a prior student of mine.

This is, importantly, a **copy** of the old repository, as there used to be answers to particular assignments hosted here. These answers have been removed from this copy, among other things. The **original** version of this repository no longer appears on Google, as I have privatized it.

You may feel free to reference the materials here if you find them useful. Though note that you will not find explicit answers to any assignment.

The lecture slides hosted here were all made from scratch by yours truly. They are *example-based* presentations, as opposed to Dr. Enbody's more conceptual presentations. I would typically go through the example code with PythonTutor or my debugger. Many of my previous students have said that they find them extremely helpful compared to Dr. Enbody's presentations, though I had not seen a significant difference in performance from my students compared to other sections' students (might not have had enough data, but that was the conclusion given two sets of around 20 students).

There's also a "cheatsheet" for every data structure type in Python, inside the "Cheatsheets" folder. These are basically copies of the official Python documentation pages but simplified a little.

Cheers,

Braedyn Lettinga

## Course Schedule

Last Refresh: 12/14/2020 04:16 PM EST

The assignments listed on the schedule have links to the corresponding website they are hosted on. Links to Mimir and D2L assignments are not direct because a login is required. You can hover over the assignment's text to see its precise due date (sorry mobile users).

Reading the weekly book chapters and watching the lecture videos can be done at any point during the week, though it's _definitely_ a good idea to do it before coming to lab and starting the assignments. It should be assumed that all assignments are due by 11:59 PM EST on their respective days, unless specified otherwise. 

If you are in a different timezone, Mimir and D2L should automatically convert our assigned times to your computer's local time, you shouldn't need to adjust anything.

Contact **me** with questions regarding most grades. I am the one that grades your labs and projects, not the professors. Chapter exercises and exam grades are based solely on the test cases (exams are conducted through Mimir if not in-person), I usually play no role in grading these assignments.

## Exam Information

There will be three exams over the course of the semester. In total, they constitute 45% of your overall course grade, where the percentage of each exam grows as the semester goes on. For each, you are allowed to have a single 8.5x11 inch sheet of notes, but no electronic devices. Non-native English speakers may bring a paper dictionary.

For no in-person meeting arrangements, we require a camera (e.g. phone camera) positioned such that you, your desk, and your computer screen is in view.
- Exam 1 (10%): Online - Tuesday, October 6th (10/6/20) at 7:00 PM EST
- Exam 2 (15%): Online - Tuesday, November 10th (11/10/20) at 7:00 PM EST
- Exam 3 (20%): Online - Wednesday, December 16th (12/16/20) at 5:45 PM EST

All issues related to the final exam will follow the policies and schedule of the University.

## General Tips

**Start projects early, I cannot stress this enough.**
Sometimes, you might be faced with a problem that you just have no idea how to implement an algorithm for. Simply taking a break and doing something else for a bit can seriously help. This also gives you time to get answers to questions you might have.

**Take it slow.** Rushing through the coding process is bound to cause issues. You should always test as you're writing, as described by the points below. 

**Always, always, always test your code as you're writing it.** Ensure that, every step of the way, you're writing a chunk or line that is doing what you're expecting it to do. Using `print()` or the debugger is good for this. 

**Talk with your friends/acquaintances.** If you can't figure out how to code something, discuss an algorithm or write pseudocode with your buds. Remember that you **cannot**, under any circumstance, share code for the projects. Even _looking_ at another person's implementation of a solution may lead you to do something similar. Simply _talking_ with another student about a project is fine. Everything else in this course is fair game to be collaborated on. Visit the [Office of the University Ombudsperson website about ADR](https://ombud.msu.edu) for more details on plaigarism.

**Take advantage of Piazza and the help room.** These are two amazing resources to use if you're having trouble with your code. You can ask questions anonymously on Piazza and get quick responses from other students and/or instructors.

**Use your IDE's debugger.** The debugger is an incredible tool that executes your code line-by-line. We'll be covering how to use the debugger during lab 2. Feel free to look into it on your own time as well. 

**When in doubt, `print()` it out.** Certainly the most classic of all the options. Print your variables out at certain points in your code to see where things went sour.

**Try [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/)!** PythonTutor visualizes your code, and gives execution control similar to an IDE debugger.
