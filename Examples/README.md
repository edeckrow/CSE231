# Examples

This folder contains Python scripts that you may find helpful in referencing for certain projects, exercises, and labs. These are not _answers_ to any particular assignment. Problems were made up for the purpose of demonstration.

### [invalid_input.py](invalid_input.py)

Contains a small algorithm that repeatedly prompts the user for a valid input based on particular conditions. 

### [open_file.py](open_file.py)

Contains a function called `open_file()` that continually re-prompts the user for a valid file name, and returns a file pointer instance when successful.

### [read_file_no_containers.py](read_file_no_containers.py)

Contains a function called `read_file_no_containers()` that finds the average, maximum, and minimum values for a data set as found in [read_file_data.txt](read_file_data.txt). The algorithm uses no containers (e.g. lists, tuples, dictionaries). 

### [read_file_with_lists.py](read_file_with_lists.py)

Contains a function called `read_file_with_lists()` that finds the average, maximum, and minimum values for a data set as found in [read_file_data.txt](read_file_data.txt). This function is a variation of the one found in read_file_no_containers.py. Instead of conditions and tracker variables, lists and standard Python functions are used.

### [pretty_print_dict.py](pretty_print_dict.py)

Contains a function called `pretty_print_dict()` that displays an input dictionary with proper indentation and newline spacing. If you typically use `print()` to debug, but can't get a good sense of what your massive and/or nested dictionary looks like, try copy-pasting this function into your program and using it!

### [RipOffSet.py](RipOffSet.py)

Contains an example class meant to simulate the Python `set` type, but uses lists to accomplish the same effects as the Python `set`.

### [VectorNoOverloads.py](VectorNoOverloads.py)

Contains an example class implementation of a two-dimensional, euclidean vector with no overloads.

### [VectorWithOverloads.py](VectorWithOverloads.py)

Contains an example class implementation of a two-dimensional, euclidean vector with overloads.

### [FractionNoOverloads.py](FractionNoOverloads.py)

Contains an example class that simulates fractions and fraction operation behaviour by only using the `int` type, uses no overloads.

### [FractionWithOverloads.py](FractionWithOverloads.py)

Contains an example class that simulates fractions and fraction operation behaviour by only using the `int` type, uses overloads.
