This is a modified version of Enbody's lab09, since his is a mess.

When you see a single-line comment that is all uppercase,
replace/write a line below that will accomplish
the described desired effect.

I encourage use of the debugger on this! The Variable Explorer
in Spyder comes in real handy alongside the debugger.

                        IMPORTANT:
When you move onto part b, DO NOT RENAME THE FILE LIKE THE PDF SAYS!
Make a copy of the part a file you're working on, and rename that copy!
Part b has you make some changes to the part a file, but Mimir wants BOTH files!

This program is meant to read in two text files, continents.txt and 
cities.txt, into a dictionary that organizes all of the data into
continents, countries, and cities. The dictionary is declared in the
global namespace above as `data_map` (Dictionaries are mutable, so
we can edit it everywhere in the program!). The program, however, is
incomplete. Can you help me out with it? ðŸ¥º

Functions main() and open_file() are completed for you. You must edit
functions build_map() and display_map(). Feel free to create the functions
from scratch if it makes more sense to you that way.

Throughout the program, treat the variable `in_file1` as continents.txt,
and treat the variable `in_file2` as cities.txt. Meaning that, when testing
the program locally, input "continents.txt" to the first prompt and
"cities.txt" for the second prompt.

`data_map` is going to be a dictionary, whose keys are strings
of the continents, and the values are other dictionaries
where the keys within those other dictionaries are
strings of countries within whatever continent, and whose values 
are lists of strings of cities that are within whatever country.

`data_map` will have a structure akin to the example here:

data_map = {
    "continent1": {
        "country1": ["city1", ...],
        ...
    },
    ...
}

# Keys are the continents
print(data_map.keys())    # Out: dict_keys(["continent1", "continent2"])

# Accessing the continent's dictionary
print(data_map["continent1"])     # Out: {"country1": ["city1", "city2"], "country2": ["city1", "city2", "city3"]}

# Accessing the cities within a continent/country
print(data_map["continent2"]["country1"])    # Out: ["city1"]
